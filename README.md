First practice website using only HTML.

In this project I will be building a basic recipe website using the HTML knowledge that I have learned so far.
The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few different recipes. I'm hoping to test my knowledge and have some fun.

(Completed HTML only project. Will be using CSS to style this website in a future project.)

UPDATE - Currently using basic CSS to style this website.
