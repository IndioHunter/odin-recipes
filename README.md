First practice website using only HTML

In this project I will be building a basic recipe website using the HTML knowledge that I have learned so far.
The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few different recipes.

Through this project I will have demonstrated my basic skills in HTML, by using different elements and attributes to create the website. I'm hoping to test my knowledge and have some fun.
