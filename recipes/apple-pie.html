        <h2>Old-Fashioned Apple Pie</h2>
            <p>This double-crust apple pie is the perfect way to welcome fall!</p>
            <p>While apple pies can be made in a variety of ways—crumble-topped, made in a skillet or slab, topped with cinnamon rolls, baked into a chess pie, doused with caramel, fried, or even topped with cheese—an old-fashioned apple pie is a straightforward classic that never goes out of style. Characterized by a double crust and lightly spiced filling, this comforting pie is an American staple, made by families for generations.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

            <h4>Crust:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>2 cups</strong> all-purpose flour, plus more for work surfaces</li>
                    <li><strong>1 cup<em> cold</em></strong> unsalted butter, cut into small pieces</li>
                    <li><strong>1 tsp.</strong> kosher salt</li>
                </ul>

            <h4>Filling:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>9 to 10</strong> Granny Smith apples, peeled and thinly sliced</li>
                    <li><strong>1/2 cup</strong> granulated sugar</li>
                    <li><strong>1/4 cup</strong> all-purpose flour</li>
                    <li><strong>1 tsp.</strong> ground cinnamon</li>
                    <li><strong>Dash</strong> of kosher salt</li>
                    <li><strong>2 Tbsp.</strong> unsalted butter, cut into small pieces</li>
                </ul>

        <h3>Directions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Prepare the Crust:</strong> 
                    Using your fingers, mix together flour, butter, and salt in a large bowl until butter is well incorporated. Gradually sprinkle 2 to 4 tablespoons very cold water into mixture, kneading as you add water, until dough just comes together. (You may not need to add water.) Turn dough out onto a lightly floured work surface; knead until it forms a smooth ball, 2 to 3 times. Divide dough in half, and shape into 2 disks. Wrap each disk in plastic wrap; chill for at least 2 hours.</li>
            
                <li><strong>Add dough to pie dish:</strong>
                    Unwrap 1 chilled dough disk, and place on a lightly floured work surface. Let stand at room temperature until slightly softened, about 5 minutes. Sprinkle with flour; roll into a 12-inch circle. Carefully fit dough round into a 9-inch deep-dish glass pie plate, leaving a 1 ½-inch overhang around edges. Refrigerate until ready to use.</li>
            
                <li><strong>Prepare the Filling:</strong>
                    Preheat oven to 425°F with oven rack in lowest position. Stir together apples, sugar, flour, cinnamon, and salt in a large bowl until apples are evenly coated. Spoon mixture into prepared piecrust; sprinkle mixture with butter.</li>
            
                <li><strong>Make lattice topping:</strong>
                    Unwrap remaining chilled pie dough disk, and place on a lightly floured work surface. Let stand at room temperature until slightly softened, about 5 minutes. Sprinkle with flour; roll into a 12-inch circle. Cut into 12 (¾-inch-wide) strips. (Discard remaining dough scraps, or use for another purpose.) Arrange strips in a lattice design over Filling; trim strips as needed to meet the bottom Crust overhang. Fold dough edges under, and crimp using your fingers or a fork.</li>
            
                <li><strong>Bake pie:</strong>
                    Place assembled pie on a rimmed baking sheet. Bake in preheated oven 15 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 350°F (leaving pie in oven); continue baking 45 minutes. Cover loosely with aluminum foil to prevent excessive browning; continue baking until juices are thick and bubbly, crust is golden brown, and apples are tender when pierced with a long wooden pick, about 30 minutes. Transfer pie to a wire rack, and cool at least 1 hour.</li>
            </ol> 
        
        <p class="end">And voilà! There you have it, a beautiful, delicious apple pie. Serve with fresh cream or ice cream and enjoy!</p>
