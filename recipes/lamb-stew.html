        <h2>Hearty Lamb Stew</h2>
            <p>This hearty, flavorful lamb stew can be made in under 2 hours, and all in one pot! With a rich, velvety broth and tender pieces of lamb, you'd be hard pressed to find a cozier cold weather meal.</p>
            <p>You might be wondering where the flour is in this recipe is. We've got good news: you don't need it! When the potatoes are added, they release their natural starches, which just so happen to be very good at thickening the stew. The resulting broth is velvety smooth and super flavorful.</p>
